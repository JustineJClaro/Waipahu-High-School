          <h1>History</h1>
          <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
          <p>Waipahu High School was founded in 1938 under the Sessions Laws of 1937 and Act 191 of 1938. The school was established to give students in Aiea, Pearl City, Waipahu, Ewa, Nanakuli and Waianae better educational opportunities.</p>
          
          <p>Mr. Dallas C. McClaren was the first principal of Waipahu High and Intermediate School which was then located at the present site of Waipahu Elementary School.</p>
              
          <p>The first graduates of Waipahu High School were the members of the class of 1941.</p>
              
          <p>Mr. Clarence B. Dyson became principal in 1942. In the same year the Alumni Association was formed.</p>
              
          <p>In April 1953, Principal Dyson passed away. In honor of him the football field at what is now Waipahu Intermediate was named after him.</p>
              
          <p>Mr. Alton V. Armstrong became principal of Waipahu High School in September 1953. Succeeding Mr. Armstrong was Mr. Gordon Kushimaejo in September 1974, then Milton Shishido till 1996, followed by Mrs. Patricia Pedersen in 1997.</p>
              
          <p>In September 1969, the move to the present site was made to accommodate the growing student enrollment. In 1972, Waipahu gained its status as a four year high school.</p>
              
          <p>In May 1976, the administration building was dedicated to former principal Alton V. Armstrong. In 1995, this building was renovated to classrooms. A new administration building was dedicated in April, 1996.</p>
              
          <p>Waipahu High School is accredited by the Western Association of School and Colleges.</p>
